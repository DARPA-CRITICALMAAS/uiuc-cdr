One common (but avoidable) hurdle we are going to run into with transition is DOI's SSL intercept.  If you have a container that makes HTTPS requests (e.g. to the CDR), it will need to contain the DOI root certificate (attached here) in its certificate store when it is deployed by USGS, and Python will need the appropriate environment variables set to point at it.  Here is what I typically use in Dockerfiles to do this:

COPY DOIRootCA2.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
RUN chmod 644 /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/DOIRootCA2.crt && \
    update-ca-certificates
# you probably don't need all of these, but they don't hurt 
ENV PIP_CERT="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" \
    SSL_CERT_FILE="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" \
    CURL_CA_BUNDLE="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" \
    REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" \
    AWS_CA_BUNDLE="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
